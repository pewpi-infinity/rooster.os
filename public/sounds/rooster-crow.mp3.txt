This is a placeholder for the rooster crow sound file.
In a production environment, you would replace this with an actual MP3 audio file of a rooster crowing.

You can find free rooster crow sound effects from:
- freesound.org
- zapsplat.com
- soundbible.com

The sound should be triggered when a bid is placed successfully.
